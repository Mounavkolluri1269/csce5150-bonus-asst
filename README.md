1. Project Title: Huffman Coding Tree

2. Author: Mounav Kolluri
3. Description:
	Huffman coding is a very efficient algorithm of data compression, which is implemented in this project by building a binary tree of nodes, where each node stands for a character and its frequency in some 	dataset. The overall representation of the data is more compact because the more frequently occurring characters would be assigned shorter codes during the construction of the tree.
4. Getting Started
	Dependencies
	Python 3.x
	Standard Python libraries: it does not rely on any external libraries, so no need to install anything extra.
	

5. Installing
	Clone or download the project files.
	Have Python installed in your environment
	Open the main script file in Python.
6. Executing program
	Colab Link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DJYL7mmj6XqMK-dU7Ct_59-1kRA3bnNH?usp=sharing
How to Run this program:
Open the terminal or command prompt.
Then, execute the following in the command line:
python huffman_coding.py
Please enter the number of characters, each character, followed by the frequency. This program will provide Huffman codes for the entered characters in.
