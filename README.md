# Huffman Coding Tree

## Author
Mounav Kolluri

## Description
Huffman coding is an efficient data compression algorithm, implemented in this project by building a binary tree of nodes. Each node represents a character and its frequency in a dataset. The tree structure assigns shorter codes to more frequently occurring characters, making the data representation more compact.
